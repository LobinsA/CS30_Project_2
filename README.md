# CS30_Project_2

This version fixed a crashing problem that was happening with the Boulders hitting Protesters.
Also, fixed out of bounds problems that was happening with the Protesters at the very edge of the oil field.
There's an addtional input key 'C' and 'c' for custom spawning of Protesters at user's coordinate.
